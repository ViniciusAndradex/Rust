// Slice
// Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is not known at compile time, so you can't use slice directly.

// ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ Here, both [i32] and str are slice types, but directly using it will cause errors. You have to use the reference of the slice instead: &[i32], &str.

// Fix the errors, DON'T add new lines!
fn one() {
    let arr: [i32;3] = [1, 2, 3];
    let s1: &[i32] = &arr[0..2];

    let s2: &str = "hello, world";

    println!("Success!");
}

// A slice reference is a two-word object, for simplicity reasons, from now on we will use slice instead
// of slice reference. The first word is a pointer to the data, and the second word is the length of the slice.
// The word size is the same as usize, determined by the processor architecture, e.g. 64 bits on an x86-64.
// Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array, and have the type signature &[T].


fn two() {

    // TIPS: slice( reference ) IS NOT an array, if it is an array, then `assert!` will be passed: Each of the two chars 'ä¸­' and 'å›½'  occupies 4 bytes, 2 * 4 = 8
    assert!(std::mem::size_of_val(&slice) == 16); // O tamanho de cada caractere na memÃ³ria passa a ser usize.
